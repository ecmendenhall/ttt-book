# ðŸŽ® Basic Game

## Creating the basic game
Last week we set up Foundry, started exploring Solidity through the test runner, and wrote a really simple Fizzbuzz contract. In Week 2, we'll create a basic Tic Tac Toe game in Solidity.

#### Goals this week
- Build out a basic framework for a Tic Tac Toe game: a data structure for the board, and functions to mark squares and check for a winner.
- Get comfortable with the basics of Solidity syntax
- Continue practicing testing using Forge 

#### Suggested homework
- Work through the [Cryptozombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) exercises at your own pace. This is an interactive introduction to Solidity.
- Keep reading through the [Solidity docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/)
- Read the [Smart Contracts and Solidity](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/07smart-contracts-solidity.asciidoc) chapter of [Mastering Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook)
